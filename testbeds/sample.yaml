# This configuration uses IP blocks intended for documentation as
# examples and will not result in a functioning VM because they are
# unlikely to be able to reach the Internet.

  # eth0 is the NAT interface.  Don't configure that.

  # Note that the global default route will be on the first of these
  # interfaces if it has a default route configured.  Othewise, any
  # VMs created based on this testbed will have no default route.
